			I WAS LOST THROUGH THESE WOODS, THAT WEIRD TV, WHAT WAS THAT? <br>
			IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW, DOES IT? <br>
			THAT THING, I THOUGHT I WASN'T ALONE, WELL, I STILL WASN'T. <br>
			BUT THAT THING WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED, IT WAS HIM. <br>
			THE ONE FROM 10 YEARS AGO. <br><br>
			
			WHY DESTINY IS SO CRUEL?, HOW DID HE COME BACK?, SO MANY QUESTIONS.
